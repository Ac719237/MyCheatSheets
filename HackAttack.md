# Phishing Attacks
Phishing attacks are used to steal sensible Information from a victim.  
To do this the Interface of the website gets cloned and shown to the victim.

The Social engineering Toolkit (SET) is in every Kali Linux Distribution available. First time using change setconfig file  
1.) Go to etc/setoolkit  
2.) nano set.config  
3.) Change APACHE SERVER=OFF

How to Hack Facebook/Instagram/ etc. Accounts

1.) Go to /usr/share/Set (First time agree to terms of services)  
2.) Run ./setoolkit programm  
3.) Select Option 1 (Social Engineering Attacks)  
4.) Select Option 2 (Website Attack Vectors)  
5.) Select Option 3 (Credential Harvest Attack Method)  
6.) Select Option 2 (Website Cloner)  
7.) Set IP-Adress of Machine on which we want to receive the Informations of the victim (check own IP in Kali Linux by typing in a new terminal ifconfig)  
Important: If the victim is in the same network use private IP, if the victim is not in same Network use Public ip (What is my IP in google, OPEN PORT 80 IN YOUR ROUTER!!)


Now the victim only needs to type in the private/public ip in his browser.
